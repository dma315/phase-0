**git add .**
	--This command is used to stage all of your changes, which means that you alert Git to the fact that you have made changes.

**git commit -m “Your commit message”**
	--This command tells Git that you have made changes and in between the quotes is where you tell Git what you did.

**git push**
	--When you are ready to share your changes with others, git push pushes the changes to a remote branch such as Github or a cloud hosting service for deployment.

**git status**
	--This command will provide you with information on the current state. You can see what files have been added, which are untracked, which are staged and which branch you are working on.

**git diff**
	--Before you stage and commit, this command will show you what you’ve changed in the repository. It is very useful for a sanity check before you commit your changes.
