# Good commit messages
	--First line is like the subject of an email, usually soft limit of 50 chars
	--Then the body, which can contain bullets on details
	--Write in the present tense -- for what the commit WILL do, as opposed to what you DID

# Steps:

1) Navigate to desired repo (in this case Phase 0)
2) Make sure we are in master
3) Checkout:  git checkout -b making-changes --> checks out (like a library?) the branch (-b), and then gives it a new name
4) Created a new directory:  mkdir week-1
5) Created a new file for reflections:  touch reflections.md
6) Edit by putting in previous reflections
7) Add (stage) for commit:  git add reflections.md
8) Commit:  git commit -v (opens up in Sublime with option to make changes)
	--Or git commit -m "Change text"
9)
