Pipes and redirection
	|:  takes output from command on the left and "pipes" it to the command on the right
	<:  takes the input from the file on the right to the program on the left
	>:  takes the output of the command on the left, then writes it to the file on the left
	>>:   takes the command on the left, then appends it to the file on the right
	Example:
		-- cat > filename.txt brings up a text editor
		-- then you type a bunch of stuff
		-- press ctrl + d to exit the text editor and it saves the file

Wildcard matching
	Syntax: Use * as way of matching before / after
		--Example:
			-- ls *.txt --> finds anything with .txt
			-- ls ex*.* --> finds anuything the starts with ex and a . later with anything in between
			-- rm *.txt --> can also be used with rm, deletes any .txt files
