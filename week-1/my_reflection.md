## 5. Web Basics Assignment and Reflection

##Part 1: Based on the resources you looked at, describe the terms you learned about.

- Browser: Software application that translates the web
- DNS: Domain Name System -- the phone book of the internet
- Domain:  A name for a site, with usually at least two levels (Top like .com, second like facebook)
- Internet:  The internet is a series of tubes! It's a network of computers that are connnect to each other.
- IP address:  Any individual computer's address on the internet. Either IPv4 or IPv6.
- Web app:  A complex site, usually that enables user interaction, amongst other cool features.
- Web server:  A software that listens for requests to load a site
- Website:  A simplistic page (different from a web app)
- World wide web: All of the site on the internet!


Explain how the internet displays your website after you push your changes.

## Part 2: Reflection
- What 2 new things did you learn about the web?

I had rough knowledge of most of the concepts here, but really appreciated the simple explanations that really crystallized the understanding. 
-Cool to know that DNS is distributed, as in a series of local name servers
-The steps for how to create a page -- getting a domain name, to hosting it all of a sudden feel a lot more clear

- How did you feel when you saw your web page live?

Pretty awesome. It's cool to see some random smattering of code live on the web. 
Lots more to do though!

- Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

The terminology that clarifies internet vs. web, website vs. web app, DNS, Domain Name vs. IP were all very illuminating. I think a lot of people use terms like those interchangeably without understanding what exactly they mean, so it's nice to to have a common language.

- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

These resources seemed pretty comprehensive, at least for a basic understanding. I'm sure as I have more questions with a specific goal in mind, I will be seeking out those resources.
