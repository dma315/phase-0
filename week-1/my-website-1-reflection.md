# My Website 1 Reflection

**1. Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.**

https://github.com/dma315/dma315.github.io

**2. Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**

1. Use the "+" button at the top right of Github.com and click "Create Repository"
2. Enter in the key information -- including the name, optionally a description, select private / public, and select a license.
3. Cloning means copying the repository to the local machine, which is done by copying the URL in the HTTPs area near the bottom / mid section to the right and in the shell, typing "git clone" followed by the link

**3. Describe what open source means.**

Open source, to my understanding, means that the code is accessible for others to modify and use freely. The upsides include having many people work on the project improve it for the greater community that might use the software / code. 

**4. What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**

I think there are great times / places for open source. Doesn't make me particularly nervous or protective. If I were trying to do a project where I'd be looking for a lot of collaboration or something that I'd like to contribute to the community, I'd definitely do open source. However, if I were designing my own website for example, don't think it makes a lot of sense for it to be open source. 

**5. Assess the importance of using licenses.**

Seems very important for making clear how software that's out in the public can be used. Admittedly, I'm still a little bit unclear on how these licenses are to be interpreted and when to use either, but I hope they will be covered in more depth later. Given the current climate of gigantic tech firms suing each other left and right, understanding the legality of software and ideas I think would be advantageous and important to anyone in this community. 

**6. What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**

It's nice to repeat the Git concepts with more practice. I'm feeling more comfortable in the command line and with the git command / workflow, so that definitely feels nice. I do have some questions though with a few steps that I may bring to office hours. 

**7. Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**

I haven't taken a deep spin into the other resources, since the exercises have been fairly straightforward thus far. I'm looking forward to diving a bit more into the Sublime Tutorial, think that will definitely help speed things up. And I do want to do some of the more advanced command line material slotted as bonus for this week. I imagine that will be really helpful to know, especially if we're going to be spending a lot of time in the command line.
