        1. What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

            Very fulfilling! It's awesome to see that we can already do basic things like create simple websites (or maybe a little sad that Berkshire doesn't have a tougher site, but hey, doens't look like they need it). Really enjoyed seeing something come to fruition.

        2. How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

            Good. I definitely think it helps to make the code more readable and am sure it will be super helpful when we start formatting.

        3. How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

            Good, it's always easy to "not" do something :)

        4. What seems good and bad about HTML?

            Good:  Looks fairly simple and easy to remember syntax once the elements have been practiced. And it appears universal.
            Bad:  Because it's so simple, it feels limiting, so I'm sure there's a lot of other stuff that needs to be layered on top.

        5. What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

            No real tricks appear yet, besides remembering and practicing. 
            I think it's helpful to remember to indent, and using Sublime definitely helps for auto completion and indents, so I'd say those ar the key things for now, but I'm sure there will be more later. 
            I also find it helpful to try and remember what the abbreviations mean. (e.g. ul = unordered list)
