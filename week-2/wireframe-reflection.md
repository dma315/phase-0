## Reflection

**1. What is a wireframe?**

A wireframe is a basic sketch of a page -- essentially with the backbone layout (header, footer, body), key objects / sections (images, text areas), and some sample content. Generally, greyscale will do, since colors will come later. 

It could also include links that help determine the pages and basic navigation.


**2. What are the benefits of wireframing?**

I think the huge benefits of wireframing are that it allows a designer to quickly sketch out the ideas and high level idea of what a page will look like without investing in the details that come later in the process. I imagine it allows for great collaboration, iteration, and rapid feedback. 

**3. Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**

Yes, absolutely. This was a lot of fun. It was an opportunity to start getting creative and start "building," even if we don't have the tools yet to do so :)

**4. Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**

I went through a few iterations before ultimately saving it, but I definitely had a few thoughts and ideas before sticking to an idea! Definitely a part of the process.

**5. What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**

I struggled a little with how detailed to let the wireframe get. I did some research into the sample wireframes and found that it really varied a lot. I liked the idea of timeboxing at the beginning and tried to do that to ensure I didn't go down the rabbithole.

**6. Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**

I really enjoyed actually sketching out the wireframe and then taking a step back to look at it. I didn't find any of this tedious at all. This was probably one of the more fun exercises yet!
