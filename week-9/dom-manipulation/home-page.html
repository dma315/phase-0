<!-- Add your reflection here

What did you learn about the DOM?
  Learned a ton! Very cool that we can select elements, modify their content, do loops on them. 
  In particular, really like the <template> component, where we can call that and use it in different occasions.

What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?
  Getting elements by ID, class, etc. all seems pretty useful. In general, a very productive learning session here!
