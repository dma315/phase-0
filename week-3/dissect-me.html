      <h3>Version Control:  WHY???</h3>
      <p>Because, that's why. As someone who's spent his career thus far living in Excel spreadsheets, paging through thousands of lines of data, there's nothing worse than not saving or waiting to work on a file while somebody else is making edits. And then to increase suffering, usually someone has to manually compile all of the files from everyone. Thank Google for Google Sheets (which of course comes with all of its own issues).</p>
      <p>That's where Git comes in. As someone just coming into the development world, but having spent a few months working with developers, I've seen the "epics" that teams have gone on. We aren't talking about a 10 sheet model here, we're talking software that people actually use. It's quite incredible that they're to get anything done without stepping on each others toes while also being able to go back and see what happened 3 weeks ago if needed. The benefits are obvious and Git does for the tech world what apparently few business people have figured out.</p>
      <p>Here are my top reasons for using git, and more specifically using Github.</p>
      <ol>
      	<li>Changes are tracked:  But not in the v1, v2 kind of way. Every every change is named, dated, and marked up, so you can see EXACTLY what changed from one version to the next.</li>
      	<li>Change are forever:  Oh, I screwed something up? Tough luck. Just kidding. Just go back. As many versions as you want.</li>
      	<li>Changes are everywhere: Left your thumb drive at home? No problem, you can grab your changes from anywhere with Github.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>How does Git keep track of changes</h3>
      <ol>
      	<li>Git allows a user to create branches (really great for collaboration) and parallel work streams.</li>
      	<li>Git then allows each branch to have multiple commits (or saves).</li>
      	<li>Each commit also contains information about what exactly was changed.</li>
      	<li>And then all of the branches and commits can be stored historically, so there's a paper trail of everything.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Why use GitHub?</h3>
      <p>Github is THE way to make sure that every significant change ever made is kept.
      <br>...and not just kept, but kept forever
      <br>...remotely (think: in the cloud)</p>
      <p>That is, I as a developer will always be able to see my code, and if I want, I can share it with anyone.
      It fosters a sense of community and makes it easy to collaborate and share...which is generally how the dev community operates!</p>

<!--

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

    We used some section elements that I think will be very helpful for breaking up key areas within a page. I found the flowchart really useful for best practice, when it comes to using the right semantic elements. Think that will be a great tool going forward. 



How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

    In general, it looks like HTML reads top to bottom, but it also tends to read parents before children.



What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

    Learned that Sublime has some cool shortcuts. Will definitely look for opportunities to create snippets for future use when there's repetitive frameworking situations. Besides snippets, looks like Sublime can reindent lines for the user, which seems like it could be really useful in following indenting best practice. I also know about COMMAND+D, which helps with multi-select.
